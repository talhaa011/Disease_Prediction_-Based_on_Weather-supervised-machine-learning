# 🌦️ Weather-Related Disease Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict weather-related diseases using patient demographics and environmental data. By leveraging weather patterns and healthcare data, the project aims to support early detection and better resource planning for health services.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Weather conditions can significantly influence the occurrence and severity of diseases. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the **type of disease** based on patient information and weather-related features, helping healthcare systems prepare for and respond to outbreaks more effectively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Develop a supervised machine learning model for predicting weather-sensitive diseases.  
- 📊 Explore and visualize trends within the dataset.  
- 🧹 Clean and preprocess data (handle nulls, encode categorical features).  
- 🧠 Use **Random Forest Classifier** and tune hyperparameters via **GridSearchCV**.  
- 📈 Evaluate the model using classification metrics.

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is [`Weather-related disease prediction.csv`](Weather-related%20disease%20prediction.csv), which contains medical and weather-related information for disease prediction.

### Key Features:

- `Age`  
- `Gender`  
- `Prognosis` (Target variable - disease diagnosis)  
- Weather-influenced factors (temperature, humidity, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Modeling and evaluation

## 🧪 Model Building

The following steps were used to build the prediction model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Label encoded categorical columns

2. **Model Training**
   - Split data into training and test sets
   - Used **Random Forest Classifier** for classification

3. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimized using `GridSearchCV`

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Count plots for age, gender distribution  
- Disease frequency bar charts  
- Heatmaps of feature correlations  
- Pie charts for categorical trends
